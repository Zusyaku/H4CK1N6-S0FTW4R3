Note: You must extract both files anywhere on your computer.
If you get any error messages try moving dssock32.ocx
to your \windows\system directory. Also, a 22.8 or higher
modem is very much recommended for using this. You may
also want to run this program several times and attack
the person with all of the running copies.

All you need to do is put an IP into the box and choose
a port to attack. If you get an error like unable to reach
host or no data entry, hit Resolve IP and see if it will
resolve. Use the result.
For port you can  use 139 or 113 these are the most 
commonly open Windows ports. If you know the guy has 
other ports open then go ahead and use them.
To listen on a port and see if you are getting attacked,
by this or other DoS tools, hit the port protector button.
its all pretty simple and i don't think i need to explain
any more. Have fun.
